<h1> Hi, Timy here. <img src="./assets/wave.gif" width="30px" height="30px"></h1> 


   Hey there! Let's connect :)
   
   Hello! I am a computer science with a passion for front-end development, software engineering, UI/UX design, and all things tech. My love for technology began the first time I sat in front of a computer, feeling a mix of excitement and trepidation. Now, years later, I am still just as passionate about technology as I was that first day. 

Currently, I am pursuing my bachelor's degree in computer science. In my coursework, I have learned a solid foundation in programming languages and concepts, including C#, Object-Oriented Programming, SQL, and data structures. When I'm not coding, you can find me immersed in the virtual world of video games or bringing my creativity to life through art. 

If you're interested in connecting with me about job opportunities or internships, I would love to hear from you. The easiest way to get in touch with me is through LinkedIn or Timyvillarmia@gmail.com.


###### Learning: C#, Javascript, SQL
