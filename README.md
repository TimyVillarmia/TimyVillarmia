### Hi, I’m Timy.

I build backend systems with **.NET** and **SQL**, often working with Azure services.
I’m currently learning **React** to better understand the frontend side.

I like experimenting with **containerization**, **Linux**, and simple **CI/CD** setups.

When I’m not coding, I play **Teamfight Tactics**.
